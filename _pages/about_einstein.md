Welcome to my digital garden. :herb: :hatching_chick:

I am a final-year Masters student at [Yuan Ze University](https://www.yzu.edu.tw/) pursuing an MS in Electrical Engineering. My research interest is in deep learning and computer vision.

At YZU, I had the opportunity to conduct research under the guidance of [Prof. Chih-Yang Lin](https://scholars.ncu.edu.tw/en/persons/chih-yang-lin) on a project coffee bean and I also join his Lab; The Computer Vision and Interactive Technology [(CVIT Lab)](https://sites.google.com/view/yzucvit/home) which is one of the Department of Mechanical Engineering Laboratories in National Central University (NCU).

In 2022, I graduated with distinction from [Syiah Kuala University](https://usk.ac.id/) with a BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) in Computer Engineering. My [undergraduate honors thesis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9865489) on provide a lightweight and understandable intelligent coffee bean automation sort accurately system that uses deep learning to assist farmers in sorting green bean arabica by variety using the benchmark deep learning models under the supervision of [Dr. Kahlil, S.T., M.Eng](https://comvis.mystrikingly.com/).

I always interested to learn new things and develop my skills to participate in various events both inside and outside the university.
